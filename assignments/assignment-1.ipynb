        "During data analysis, encountering missing data is quite common. These missing values can adversely affect the data analysis workflow because you may need to make decisions on how to handle these gaps. Should you fill in missing values, or should you ignore them? Each option has its own consequences, and these decisions impact the data analysis. Often, the data you come across doesn't always come with a research question. Therefore, understanding the reason for the missing values is crucial.\n",
